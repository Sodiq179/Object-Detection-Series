# Object Detection Series

This repo contains the codes written during my exploration of different object detection models. The series teaches about applying object detection models to various tasks in computer vision. Along the way, I learnt how to use the YOLO architectures as well as the Google Colab.


## Overview of Computer Vision

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs â€” and take actions or make recommendations based on that information.

The following is a list of common Computer Vision tasks, with some examples of each:

- **Image Classification**: Classifying images into different classes e.g classification of cat and dog images
- **Image Segmentation**: Method of dividing a digital image into subgroups called image segments, reducing the complexity of the image and enabling further processing or analysis of each image segment. 
- **Object Detection**: Object Detection is a computer vision task in which the goal is to detect and locate objects of interest in an image or video.
