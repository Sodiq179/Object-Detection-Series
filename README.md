# Object Detection Series

This repo contains the codes written during my exploration of different object detection models. The series teaches about applying object detection models to various tasks in computer vision. Along the way, I learnt how to use the YOLO architectures as well as the Google Colab.

## Overview of Computer Vision
Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field of study that focuses on enabling machines to interpret and understand visual data such as images and videos. The goal of computer vision is to develop algorithms and techniques that allow computers to extract meaningful information from visual data, similar to the way humans perceive and understand the world around them.

Some of the key tasks in computer vision include:
- **Image Classification**: involves categorizing an image into one or more predefined classes or categories. For example, image classification can be used to identify if a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan of the brain has a tumor or not.

- **Object Detection**: involves identifying and locating objects within an image or video. For example, object detection can be used to locate and identify brain tumors within Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans using bounding boxes.

- **Segmentation**: involves dividing an image into multiple segments or regions, each of which represents a different object or part of the image. For example, image segmentation can be used to identify and group pixels in an MRI scan as a region with tumor and region without tumor.
